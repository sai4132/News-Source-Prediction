# News-Source-Prediction
This is a course project for my 1st semester course Neural Networks for NLP.

Origin of a news can be diferent from the source we received the news from. One may even state that the origin of the news from a credible source to push one's agenda. This project aims to use NLP techniques to avoid from spread of fake news and especially in the name of credible news sources.

### Dataset:
